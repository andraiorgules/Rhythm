## Description 
The inspiration that I used for this project was a picture of an abandoned industrial tunnel. The beginning of the audio is supposed to represent randomly waking up in one of these abandoned tunnels. You start off slowly, you’re confused and 
kind of “waiting” for something to happen, then things start hissing and clanging, after which a siren sounds and everything speeds up. Now you’re hearing metal parts move on their own, and multiple sets of footsteps that get closer and closer. 
Everything gets louder and faster until it stops, and you “wake up” in the beginning again. The element that carries the rhythm is the drip-drops of water droplets. There are leaky pipes lining the entirety of the walls in the photo, so I felt 
like the “drip-drip” sound would be pretty inescapable in this situation. I chopped up an audio clip of a leaky faucet to create different rhythmic patterns for different parts of the project. I also chopped up the two higher pitched sets of 
footsteps, rearranged them, and sped some of them up to make it sound like I had a larger variety of footsteps than I actually did.
